# ``FileBuilder``

A package for generating files and directories in a declarative manner. 

This package generates files and directories in a declarative manner, allowing you to think about the contents rather than the “book-keeping” required for representing file hierachies and creating text files.

Two result builders are provided, `FileBuilder` and `TextBuilder`, and using these to build file hierarchies is similar to using SwiftUI for building view hierarchies.
